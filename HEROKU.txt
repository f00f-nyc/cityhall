This is a quick guide on how to get set up on Heroku.  It assumes that you have
a Heroku login which you can use.  Heroku offers a free-tier dyno which will be
more than enough to run City Hall for testing purposes.



	GET THE SOURCE CODE

You will have to get the source code, and set up the virtual environment.
The important part here is that cityhall/master will not run Heroku, you will
have to fetch the branch specifically made for Heroku.

$ git clone https://github.com/f00f-nyc/cityhall.git
$ git fetch origin runon/heroku



    PRE SET UP

If you won't be running locally, you can ignore this step.

You will need to have to have Python, virtualenv,  and pip installed.  
In addition to the standard fare of Python, you will to have had installed
Postgres and set up a database URL (which will be used dj-database-url 
library).  For example, in order to write this guide, that value was:
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/cityhall
   
You will also need to create and set up a virtual environment

$ cd cityhall
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt



    SET UP HEROKU

You will need to download the toolbelt for your OS.

(env)$ heroku login
(env)$ heroku create digitalborderlands
  Here, we are giving the app a name, but if you leave it blank, Heorku
  will create a name for you

(env)$ git push heroku runon/heroku:master
  Note that we have specify our existing branch to be pushed
  
(env)$ heroku run python cityhall/manage.py syncdb
  This has to be done in order to create the database.  If this command times
  out, you might see a connection timeout error, which usually happens before
  you're behind a firewall of some kind and that port (5000) is blocked.
  

(env)$ heroku open
You will now be able to use the app.  Log in with "cityhall" and no password.

    

    RUN LOCALLY
    
(env)$ heroku local
This will open the app on your own machine, or port 5000.
